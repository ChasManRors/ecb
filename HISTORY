Version 1.20 (???):
-------------------

- Now ECB is ediff-friendly: During ediff is active the advices of ECB are
  temporally deactivated! (Klaus)

- Now all tree-buffers (ECB-buffers) are read-only (Klaus)!

- Better implementation of advising the functions. Now all adviceable
  functions are completely independent from each other (Klaus)!

- Mon Apr 2 21:20:34 2001 (burton@relativity.yi.org): (KAB) merge my modeline
  additions... this removes the redundant modeline info and shows important
  information.  

- Added new option `ecb-advice-window-functions'. Enabling the intelligent
  window functions via customize. No hook hacking necessary anymore!
  Now the intelligent window functions are implemented by advicing (klaus).

- Better online help display (Klaus).

- Added new option 'ecb-left-mouse-jump-destination' (thanks to David Hay for
  suggestion <David.Hay@requisite.com>.

- Adviced 'other-window' acts now exactly like the original but always related
  to 'ecb-other-window-jump-behavior' (klaus)!

- Fixed bug with 'ecb-compile-window-height'. Now ECB has always the correct
  compile-window height after compilation-output (compile, grep etc.)

- New option 'ecb-compile-window-temporally-enlarge'. Allowing
  Emacs-compilation to enlarge the ECB-compile-window temporally.


Version 1.10 (2001-03-25):
--------------------------

- Automatic expansion of the directory tree.

- Method parsing is now recursive, so that for example inner classes
  in Java are shown in the methods buffer.

- Variables are now shown in the methods buffer.

- Selected files and directories now use the secondary-selection
  face. Thanks to Kevin A. Burton <burton@relativity.yi.org> for this
  patch.

- Fixed some issues with XEmacs. Thanks to Colin Marquardt
  <colin.marquardt@usa.alcatel.com> for this.

- Fixed bug with truncating lines in tree-buffer.el.

- The methods buffer can now be automatically updated when the source
  file is saved.

- Help text is available with "ecb-show-help".

- Moving the mouse over a node shows the name in the
  mini-buffer. Currently this only works when follow-mouse is
  activated.


Version 1.0 (2001-03-17):
-------------------------

- Changed name from JCB to ECB and prefix from "jde-jcb-" to "ecb-".

- Works with semantic 1.3.1 and higher.

- Fixed a couple of bugs when creating and deleting files.

- Grouped customization variables.


Contributed by Klaus Berndl <klaus.berndl@sdm.de>:

- A lot of intelligent ECB window-functions (e.g. ecb-delete-window) which
  gives you the feeling as if the edit-window is the only window of the ECB
  frame.

- New layout functionality.

- The history buffer can optionally be sorted and also cleared.

- The package expanded symbol can optionally be placed before the package name.

- Syntax highlighting of the methods buffer.

- Show argument names and return type in the methods buffer.

- History clear function: ecb-clear-history.

- Added pop-up menu to the history buffer.

- Fixed edit buffer sync bug.



Version 0.04 (2000-11-07):
--------------------------

- Keyboard navigation in JCB buffers. Use Return to select and Tab to expand.

- Tree view of packages.

- Class files can be viewed in the packages buffer.

- Better handling of mouse events.

- Automatic update of the packages buffer.

- Added pop-up menus to the packages and classes buffers. They are activated 
  with mouse button 3 (right button).

- Added method sorting. Thanks to Brian Anderson <brian.anderson@luna.com> 
  for this improvement.


Version 0.03 (2000-07-28):
--------------------------

- Fixed naming of variables.

- Fixed license and copyright comments.

- Fixed class file regular expression bug. 
  Thanks to Jim Loverde <loverde@str.com> for finding it.

- Added three new layouts.

- The JCB buffers can now be (almost) synchronized with the edit window.

- When clicking on a class or method using mouse button 2, it will be loaded
  into another window. A new customization variable was added for this.

- Minor changes. Thanks to Jim for his suggestions.

- Removed the "jde-jcb-window-skips-from-methods-buffer" and 
  "jde-jcb-window-skips-from-history-buffer" customization variables.


Version 0.02 (2000-07-15):
--------------------------

- Changed prefix from "jcb-" to "jde-jcb-". This will cause JCB customization 
  variables to be saved in JDE project files.

- Lists and parses non-Java file types. Currently the C and Lisp parsers from 
  semantic-ex.el are used.

- History buffer implemented.

- Layout function implement. Thanks to Jim Loverde <loverde@str.com> for 
  helping out with this.

- Packages matching a regular expression can be excluded from the packages 
  buffer. Thanks to Mark Gibson <mark@markg.co.uk> for this feature.

--------------------------

- Initial version.
