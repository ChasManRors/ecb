- Maybe ECB should optionally create its own frame when activated. (JN)

- Ignore source files specified in .cvsignore files. (JN)

- Add history back/forward functions. Should behave similar to web browser
  history, which means we should keep a history list and a current position
  in the history list. (JN)

- Optionally add "(file . line-nr)" to history when clicking on methods in
  the methods buffer. (JN)

- KB: support env vars, like the latest JDE, for settings like the source paths?

- KB: use the JDE source paths if the JDE variable is available 
   (perhaps there are other variables to use by default as well?). We
   should add an option where this external source-paths can be defined.

- Possibility to save the current sizes of the windows. This will make it
  possible to customize the layout better. (JN)

- KB: Special keymap for all ECB-buffers for better keyboard-usability:
  If the ECB-buffers are readonly (see above) then we can do the
  following: Instead of scrolling with the mouse each inserted
  character scrolls to the next matching tree-node. Example:
  Inserting 'e' scrolls to the first node beginning with "e...".
  Then inserting an 'c' scrolls to the first node beginning with
  "ec...". Maybe we need an somehow intelligent mechanism...

- KB: Easy selecting of a certain ECB-buffer with a ECB-keymap like:
  [C-c C-e ...] as ECB-keybindings:
   d: Directory buffer
   s: Source-Buffer
   m: Method-buffer
   h: History-Buffer

- KB: the utility- (also know as compile-) window stores not only the
  last compilation-buffer but a list of recent utility-buffers
   (compilation-, help-, etc. buffers) which can the easily cycled
   through by a new ecb-command (maybe also bound to a [C-c C-e ...] key?
