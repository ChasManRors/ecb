Readme for the Emacs Code Browser (ECB) v1.20
---------------------------------------------

About
-----

This package contains a code browser for several languages for Emacs. For
instructions on how to use the browser read the online-help (see "Usage"
below) file. The latest version of this package can be found at:

http://home.swipnet.se/mayhem/ecb.html


Requirements
------------

ECB requires version 1.3.3 of Eric's semantic bovinator
(http://www.ultranet.com/~zappo/semantic.shtml).  If Java code is
edited the ECB works best when the JDE package
(http://sunsite.auc.dk/jde) is installed.


Installation
------------

1. Unpack the ECB archive.
2. Add the new directory to your load-path.
3. Add to your .emacs or site-start.el file the line:
   (require 'ecb)

Optional byte-compilation steps:

4. Restart Emacs.
5. Call `ecb-byte-compile'. You can safely ignore all messages.

(You can also bytecompile ECB from the command-line either by using the
Makefile or by using the batch-file make.bat. Just read the comments in that
file you choose.)


Usage
-----

Call "M-x ecb-activate" to activated ECB.
Call "M-x ecb-show-help" to get a detailed online-help for ECB.
