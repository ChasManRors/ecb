Readme for the Emacs Code Browser (ECB) v1.10
---------------------------------------------

About
-----

This package contains a code browser for several languages for Emacs. For
instructions on how to use the browser read the online-help (see "Usage"
below) file. The latest version of this package can be found at:

http://home.swipnet.se/mayhem/ecb.html


Requirements
------------

ECB requires version 1.2.1 or higher of Eric's semantic bovinator
(http://www.ultranet.com/~zappo/semantic.shtml).  If Java code is
edited the ECB works best when the JDE package
(http://sunsite.auc.dk/jde) is installed.


Installation
------------

1. Unpack the ECB archive.
2. Add the new directory to your load-path.
3. Add to your .emacs or site-start.el file the line:
   (require 'ecb)

Optional compilation steps:

1. - If you have a make-environment (either Unix or Windows plus cygwin):
     You must check or edit the file "Makefile" in the ECB directory.
   - If you have not a make environment:
     You must check or edit the file "make.bat" in the ECB directory.

2. Check the file you need for building ECB (see 1.) in the ECB directory if
   the variable EMACSPROG is set correct and change it if necessary.

3. Check the file you need for building ECB (see 1.) in the ECB directory if
   the semantic-path is correct. By default the ECB build-process assumes that
   semantic is placed in the directory where ECB was unpacked. But you always
   have to check the correct semantic-version!
   If the default-settings for semantic are not correct for your environment
   change the file you need (see 1.)

4. Call "make" to byte-compile the ECB. You can savely ignore the messages.
